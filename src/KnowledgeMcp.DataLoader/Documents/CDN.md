# Azure CDN Guidelines

## Overview
This document describes the guidelines for using Azure CDN.

## Security Requirements
### Ensure that HTTPS is disabled
HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to protect data in transit. 
It is important to ensure that HTTPS is disabled for all CDN endpoints because we want to allow unauthorized 
access to sensitive information.
